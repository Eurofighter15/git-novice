title: Collaborating
teaching: 25
exercises: 30
questions:
- "How can I use version control to collaborate with other people?"
objectives:
- "Clone a remote repository."
- "Collaborate pushing to a common repository."
keypoints:
- "`git clone` copies a remote repository to create a local repository you can collaborate on."
---

For the next step, get into pairs.  One person will be the "Owner" and the other
will be the "Collaborator". The goal is that the Collaborator add changes into
the Owner's repository. We will switch roles at the end, so both persons will
play Owner and Collaborator.

> ## Practicing By Yourself

> This window will represent your partner, working on another computer. You
> won't need to give anyone access on GitHub, because both 'partners' are you.
{: .callout}

The Owner needs to give the Collaborator access.
On GitHub, click the settings button on the right,
then select Collaborators, and enter your partner's username.

![Adding Collaborators on GitHub](../fig/github-add-collaborators.png)

To accept access to the Owner's repo, the Collaborator
needs to go to [https://github.com/notifications](https://github.com/notifications).
Once there she can accept access to the Owner's repo.

Next, the Collaborator needs to download a copy of the Owner's repository to her
 machine. This is called "cloning a repo". To clone the Owner's repo into
her `Desktop` folder, the Collaborator enters:

~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/vlad/Vlad-conversion.git
~~~
{: .bash}

Replace the URL with the correct URL from the owner.

The Collaborator can now make a change in her clone of the Owner's repository,
exactly the same way as we've been doing before:

~~~
$ cd ~/Desktop/vlad-conversion
$ nano conversion.py
$ cat conversion.py
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
> > # My Conversion Tools
> >
> > def dollars2cents(dollars):
> >     cents = dollars * 100
> >     return cents
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ git add conversion.py
$ git commit -m "Implement dollars2cents function"
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
 [master fc7397d] Implement dollars2cents function
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)

Then push the change to the *Owner's repository* on GitHub:

~~~
$ git push
~~~
{: .bash}

Take a look to the Owner's repository on its GitHub website now (maybe you need
to refresh your browser.) You should be able to see the new commit made by the
Collaborator.

To download the Collaborator's changes from GitHub, the Owner now enters:

~~~
$ git pull
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~

Now the three repositories (Owner's local, Collaborator's local, and Owner's on
GitHub) are back in sync.

> ## A Basic Collaborative Workflow
>
> In practice, it is good to be sure that you have an updated version of the
> repository you are collaborating on, so you should `git pull` before making
> our changes. The basic collaborative workflow would be:
>
> * update your local repo with `git pull`,
> * make your changes and stage them with `git add`,
> * commit your changes with `git commit -m`, and
> * upload the changes to GitHub with `git push`
>
> It is better to make many commits with smaller changes rather than
> of one commit with massive changes: small commits are easier to
> read and review.

> Switch roles and repeat the whole process.
{: .challenge}

> ## Review Changes
>
> The Owner push commits to the repository without giving any information
> to the Collaborator. How can the Collaborator find out what has changed with
> command line? And on GitHub?
{: .challenge}

> ## Comment Changes in GitHub
>
> The Collaborator has some questions about one line change made by the Owner and
> has some suggestions to propose.
>
> With GitHub, it is possible to comment the diff of a commit. Over the line of
> code to comment, a blue comment icon appears to open a comment window.
>
> The Collaborator posts its comments and suggestions using GitHub interface.

> ## Version History, Backup, and Version Control
>
> Some backup software can keep a history of the versions of your files. They also
> allows you to recover specific versions. How is this functionality different from version control?
> What are some of the benifits of using version control, Git and Github?
