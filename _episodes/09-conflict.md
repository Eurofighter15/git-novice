title: Conflicts
teaching: 10
exercises: 10
questions:
- "What do I do when my changes conflict with someone else's?"
objectives:
- "Explain what conflicts are and when they can occur."
- "Resolve conflicts resulting from a merge."
keypoints:
- "Conflicts occur when two or more people change the same file(s) at the same time."
- "The version control system does not allow people to overwrite each other's changes blindly, but highlights conflicts so that they can be resolved."

As soon as people can work in parallel, it's likely someone's going to step on someone
else's toes.  This will even happen with a single person: if we are working on
a piece of software on both our laptop and a server in the lab, we could make
different changes to each copy.  Version control helps us manage these
[conflicts]({{ page.root }}/reference/#conflicts) by giving us tools to
[resolve]({{ page.root }}/reference/#resolve) overlapping changes.

**The condensed version:**
We've created lots of different versions of the same file by having each person change the contributors.txt file independently.

Let's take a look at how GitHub prompts us to merge these conflicting items.


**The original version, if time permits:**

To see how we can resolve conflicts, we must first create one.  The file
`conversion.py` currently looks like this (ed: or can be made to look like this) in both partners' copies of our `conversions`
repository:

~~~
$ cat conversion.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
# My Conversion Tools

def dollars2cents(dollars):
    cents = dollars * 100
    return cents
~~~
{: .output}

Let's add a new convert function to one partner's copy only:

~~~
$ nano conversion.py
$ cat conversion.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
# My Conversion Tools

def dollars2cents(dollars):
    cents = dollars * 100
    return cents

def gallons2liters(gallons):
    liters = gallons * 3.78541
    return liters
~~~
{: .output}

and then push the change to GitHub:

~~~
$ git add conversion.py
$ git commit -m "Adding gallons2liters function"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
[master 5ae9631] Adding gallons2liters

~~~
{: .output}

Now let's have the other partner
make a different change to their copy
*without* updating from GitHub:

~~~
$ nano conversion.py
$ cat conversion.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
# My Conversion Tools

def dollars2cents(dollars):
    cents = dollars * 100
    return cents

def hours2minutes(hours):
    minutes = hours * 60
    return hours
~~~
{: .output}

We can commit the change locally:

~~~
$ git add conversion.py
$ git commit -m "Adding hours2mintes function"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
[master 07ebc69] Adding hours2mintes
 1 file changed, 5 insertion(+)
~~~
{: .output}

but Git won't let us push it to GitHub:

~~~
$ git push
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
To https://github.com/biologyguy/conversions.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)

![The Conflicting Changes](../fig/conflict.svg)

Git detects that the changes made in one copy overlap with those made in the other
and stops us from trampling on our previous work.
What we have to do is pull the changes from GitHub,
[merge]({{ page.root }}/reference/#merge) them into the copy we're currently working in,
and then push that.
Let's start by pulling:

~~~
$ git pull
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1/1), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 2), reused 3 (delta 2), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.

Auto-merging conversion.py
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in conversion.py
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
~~~
{: .output}

`git pull` tells us there's a conflict,
and marks that conflict in the affected file:

~~~
$ cat conversion.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
# My Conversion Tools

def dollars2cents(dollars):
    cents = dollars * 100
    return cents

<<<<<<< HEAD
def hours2minutes(hours):
    minutes = hours * 60
    return hours
=======
def gallons2liters(gallons):
    liters = gallons * 3.78541
    return liters
>>>>>>> 5fa9f4bbc64cfea4231f462afb1147b8e4703aaa
~~~
{: .output}

Our change (the one in `HEAD`) is preceded by `<<<<<<<`.
Git has then inserted `=======` as a separator between the conflicting changes
and marked the end of the content downloaded from GitHub with `>>>>>>>`.
(The string of letters and digits after that marker
identifies the commit we've just downloaded.)

It is now up to us to edit this file to remove these markers
and reconcile the changes.
We can do anything we want: keep the change made in the local repository, keep
the change made in the remote repository, write something new to replace both,
or get rid of the change entirely.

In this case, we want both functions, so let's simply delete the
 merge-generated markup.

~~~
$ nano conversion.py
$ cat conversion.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
# My Conversion Tools

def dollars2cents(dollars):
    cents = dollars * 100
    return cents


def hours2minutes(hours):
    minutes = hours * 60
    return hours


def gallons2liters(gallons):
    liters = gallons * 3.78541
    return liters
~~~
{: .output}

To finish merging,
we add `conversion.py` to the changes being made by the merge
and then commit:

~~~
$ git add conversion.py
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
On branch master
Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:

  modified:   conversion.py
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ git commit -m "Merging changes from GitHub"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~

Now we can push our changes to GitHub:

~~~
$ git push
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~

Git keeps track of what we've merged with what,
so we don't have to fix things by hand again
when the collaborator who made the first change pulls again:

~~~
$ git pull
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
remote: Counting objects: 6, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.

We get the merged file:

~~~
$ cat conversion.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

# My Conversion Tools

def dollars2cents(dollars):
    cents = dollars * 100
    return cents


def hours2minutes(hours):
    minutes = hours * 60
    return hours


def gallons2liters(gallons):
    liters = gallons * 3.78541
    return liters

We don't need to merge again because Git knows someone has already done that.

Version control's ability to merge conflicting changes
 is another reason users tend to divide their programs and papers into
 multiple files instead of storing everything in one large file.
 There's another benefit too: whenever there are repeated conflicts
 in a particular file, the version control system is essentially trying
 to tell its users that they ought to clarify who's responsible for
 what, or find a way to divide the work up differently.
