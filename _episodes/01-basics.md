This workshop is trimmed from the full Software Carpentry Intro to Git lesson. In order to fit two sessions into one afternoon, we're making a few preparatory steps simpler:

* Mark yourself off on the sign-in sheet at the front of the room.
* Log in using the guest user name and password next to your computer.
* If there aren't two sticky notes by your computer, get one of each color.

We'll use the sticky notes for signaling the instructor and the helpers during the class. That way you don't need to have your hand up while waiting for someone to be free to help.

* Yellow is Yes / Agree / Happy / I'm Caught Up.
* Blue is No / Disagree / Sad / I Need Help.


Things we're assuming:
* You signed up for this class because you're already interested in using Git for version control - we probably don't need to give you the "why Git and version control are important" overview.

Next up: Logging in and getting set up
