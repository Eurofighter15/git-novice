This workshop is trimmed from the full Software Carpentry Intro to Git lesson. In order to fit two sessions into one afternoon, we're making a few preparatory steps simpler:

* Mark yourself off on the sign-in sheet at the front of the room.
* Log in using the guest user name and password next to your computer.
* If there aren't two sticky notes by your computer, get one of each color.
